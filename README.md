Monitoring_23

Code for the course of Monitoring Ecosystem Changes and Functioning @Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna

In this repository I stored all the code I wrote during the course.

Due to working necessities I will follow lessons from Panopto recorded in 2021/2022

After that I will check and comment the code from the current academic year by myself.
